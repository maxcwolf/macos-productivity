# Become a More Productive Developer on Mac OS

I work on Windows, Mac, and Linux for development, but my preferred development platform of choice is Mac. This is for a variety of reasons, mainly because it is a UNIX system (like Linux) so there are a lot of great command line tools available *AND* it is the most efficient platform in terms of developer experience in my opinion.

On a Windows machine it can be very hard to not use your mouse for a lot of things, but on a Mac you almost never need to use your mouse if you know what you are doing. This helps with wrist and hand strain, which makes a difference over time, as well as speeding up the time to complete mundane tasks noticeably. 

1. Use `Cmd + Space` to open **EVERYTHING** *(except VSCode)*! Just start typing what you want to open then enter after a few letters. For example, if you want to open Chrome, just click `Cmd + Space`, then type `c` + `h` + `r`, then `Enter`.  This is much faster than mousing/trackpadding around your dock or finder looking for an app to open.
    >- The built in "Spotlight" app in Mac OS is your friend, and should be the ONLY way you open applications, unless using the command line to launch files/folders
    >- If you want to try something even more powerful, try [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

2. Use the `code` terminal command to open VSCode from the command line. You almost never will open VSCode any other way. In the terminal, `cd` into the folder that you want to open in VSCode and type `code .` to launch VSCode with that folder as your workspace.

3. Use `Cmd + Tab` to switch windows! It's much faster than than using the dock. 

4. Work in fullscreen mode `Ctrl + Cmd + F`. You get more real estate on your small laptop screen. And with points 1 and 3 above, you wont need to ever use your dock again. You can switch between apps and open new ones easily while keeping all your apps in full screen mode. 

5. In VSCode, use `Cmd + P` to go to any file in your open project. Just start typing the name of the file and click enter. You won't have to look through all of your files and find the one you want to click on. You will save time, and your wrist from having to use the mouse/trackpad. 

6. VSCode has hundreds of hotkeys. Start using them now and get to know them. If you find yourself using your mouse to copy, paste, and move text around... you are doing it wrong.  I'm not going to go over all of these, but you can find most of them here: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf  
   > Try this one to see how much time it can save you: To select a word, use `Cmd + D`. If you hit `Cmd + D` more than once, youâ€™ll add another occurrence of the same keyword to your selection. Now start editing or deleting the first selection.... It edits all of them at the same time! This may not seem like much now, but believe me, it's huge!


7. BONUS: If you want to get really crazy, try the Vimium extension for Chrome. Surf the web without ever needing to use your mouse/trackpad!
